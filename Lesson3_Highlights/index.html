            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control software allows you, and multiple other users, to simultaneously work on the same file or file set, while also tracking all of these changes. In this process, not only is the history of changes in the files tracked, but also who completed the change, and even comments on why the change was made, can be saved for others to use, view and follow. This is very helpful in this field since version control software allows users to revert the file back to a previous change if backtracking needs to be made. Similarly, this is helpful for group projects, which will not only be done in this class or a scholarly setting, but throughout this entire field, as developers constantly and consistently work with designers, and other company and department heads. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In the field controversy over project design and implementation is almost guaranteed.  Everyone usually comes up with slightly different solutions on how to solve a problem, and create products. Whether that product is a website, an algorithm/code, or a simple file, controversy and the flowing of ideas often leads to successful project development. Heated controversy even led to the initial development of GIT, as well as later changes and improvement. GIT software itself is ideal for dealing with controversy within other projects, as it allows individual users to make changes, comment and explain why these changes were done, and save them as well as past versions incase the new versions are not agreed upon. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The checksum process is ultimately the key to GIT’s survival and success. It is the main difference between GIT and other version control software systems. In this checksum process, every time a file is saved or added to your git repository, it is hashed and the hash is saved. This hash is rechecked every time the file is worked on. Even if one minor change is made to the file, for example an extra space is added, this small difference would lead to a very different hash. Therefore, practically no changes could be made to the file without git knowing and having record of it. Due to this, there is an extremely small chance data and changes can be lost within the repository. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Three Stages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git operates on a three stage, or three part, process. These three parts include: The working directory, the staging area, and the .git directory (or repository). The git directory, or repository, is the most important part of the three, as it is ultimately where files are taken from, or “checked-out from” and returned too. Files are then moved to the “working area” while they are being modified and updated. As changes are being worked on, the changes are recorded in the Staging Area. These changes are kept here so they can easily be finally saved, or “commit-ed” to the main repository once the user is completed with their work for that period of time. None of the changes are reflected in the main repository until the end, once the user does a commit. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Blaming Others</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">How does git keep track of who does what change to each file? Simple – it blames them. By running the simple command “git blame”, git will give you a line-by-line report of who made what change to the file. Git will even provide a timestamp for when a specific user made a change. However, on large data files, this blame report can be extremely lengthy. So, one option git provides is a filter feature. For example, you can filter the report to not show specific types of changes, such as ones that only affected the amount of whitespace in a certain area. </p>
